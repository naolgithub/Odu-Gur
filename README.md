## â›” Problem: 

The problem that we tackled concerning this challenge is the lack of accessibility and availability of usersâ€™ data, which ends up harming digital entrepreneurship in Algeria eventually.

## ðŸŽ¯ Main goal : 

Our main goal with this project is to make the local Algerian userâ€™s data available for analytics and data scientists or AI models for digital businesses and entrepreneurs that are planning to improve their product or their services and therefore their profitability .

## ðŸ’¡ Solution: 

As a solution we suggested a mobile application that targets usersâ€™ data through quizzes, surveys and tests ,and sells it to enterprises .And spread the app through a good affiliate program.
